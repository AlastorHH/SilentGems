# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Glowroses can now be planted in vanilla flower pots. This amplifies their light level to 15.
### Fixed
- Nether and End gems not spawning. Currently, both will spawn multi-gem ore. The overworld still has biome-dependent spawns.
- Glowrose hit box and collision fixed
- Silent Gear part files corrected. These should function correctly whenever Gear is ready to release.

## [3.0.1] - 2019-02-21
### Fixed
- Crash caused by a build error [#354]

## [3.0.0] - 2019-02-21
Ported to 1.13.2. This version will bring some major changes:
- The Flattening has changed almost every block and item ID. Old worlds are not compatible.
- Tools and armor have been removed.
    - For a similar system, check out Silent Gear.
    - I am considering a mod which will add simple, non-upgradeable gem tools.
- The chaos system is gone, for now. I am working on an alternative. Chaos was never intended to be an energy system and I hope to make it into something more interesting.
