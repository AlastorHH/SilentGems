# Changelog

## [3.0.0] - 2019-02-21
Ported to 1.13.2. This version will bring some major changes:
- The Flattening has changed almost every block and item ID. Old worlds are not compatible.
- Tools and armor have been removed.
    - For a similar system, check out Silent Gear.
    - I am considering a mod which will add simple, non-upgradeable gem tools.
- The chaos system is gone, for now. I am working on an alternative. Chaos was never intended to be an energy system and I hope to make it into something more interesting.
